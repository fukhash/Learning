# MachineLeaningPersonalUniversity
This is a road map of my personal way to know Machine Learning and Python related programming knowledges.

**Issues**

- _'Checklist'_ is a markbox so I can vizualize what is going on with my journey.

- _'AllUsefullContent'_ bring some usefull websites that I want to share and save.

- _'PersonalSchedule'_ this is just a place to put fast clicks.

**Projects**

Well that's my schedule!
