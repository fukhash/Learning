# Usefull contents about Computer Science

Here is a bunch of stuff that I'm stacking up so I can save for the future studies.

**Issues**

- _'Checklist'_ A markbox so I can vizualize what is going on.

- _'AllUsefullContent'_ Usefull websites that I want to save.


**Projects**

Well that's my schedule!
