# MachineLeaningPersonalUniversity
This is a road map of my personal way to know Machine Learning and Python related programming knowledges.

**Issues**

- 'Checlist' is something to know how we are doing on our road.

- 'AllUsefullContent' bring some usefull websites that I want to share.

- 'PersonalSchedule' this is just a place to put fast clicks.

**Projects**

That's my schedule!

Feel free to contribute if you think its going to help someone!
